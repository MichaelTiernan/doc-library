## Code of Conduct

In the past, we never faced a situation where a guideline was needed. Everybody
should be aware of good behavior and should know, how to talk to people.

Nevertheless, we are having a document derived from <https://www.contributor-covenant.org>. Maybe you want to consider reading the whole
[Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Project Contribution

Contributing to While True Do is appreciated. We are open for new ideas,
helping with the community, bug reports, helps with testing, etc. In this
section you will find some hints. If your way of contribution is not explained
here, please feel free to discuss your idea with us.

### Bug Reports

Reporting Bugs should follow some simple rules:

-   **Check**, if you can find similar Bugs
-   **Describe, what** is happening and what should happen
-   **Explain, why** this is a problem
-   **Add** more details and attachments
-   **Follow up**, if somebody is having questions or needs more details

### Feature Requests

Requesting a new feature is also following some simple rules:

-   **Check**, if the feature is already requested
-   **Describe, what** your feature will bring to the community
-   **Explain** the criteria to fulfill the request
-   **Add** more details like mock ups, attachments, lists, screenshots
-   **Follow Up** in the discussion to the feature
-   **Be patient**, it may take some time

### Code Contribution

Contributing Code should be as easy as possible. Therefore, all needed
information should be present in the README of each repository. Some basic
rules should be applied.

-   **Open an issue** for each code contribution (see above)
-   **One Contribution** should solve **one issue**
-   **Tested** code is **cool** code
-   **Documented** code is **Maintainable** code
-   **Commit Messages** should be useful and self explaining

### Community Work

Contribution does not mean, that one needs to code. You can also help in many
other ways like Blogging, Spreading the word, Testing and Reporting, Drawing,
Writing, participating to events, etc.

Please feel free to reach out to us to discuss your options. We encourage you
to help us in any way you like to.

## Additional Guides

When contributing, you may face situations where you need a little bit more
guidance. In this section, we are collecting documents, which may help you. If
something is missing, please feel free to reach out to us.

### Versioning Guide

We are sticking to **Semantic Versioning** for all repositories and products.
You can read everything about it in [VERSIONING.md](./VERSIONING.md) or at
the website <https://semver.org/>

### Style Guide
<!--
FIXME: After finishing the Style Guide, the below paragraph must be re-written.
-->

We are currently working on a Style Guide, which will show details like logos,
ideals, fonts, colors, etc. It's not finished, but improving.

You will find the current Version of the guide in
[STYLE_GUIDE.md](./STYLE_GUIDE.md).

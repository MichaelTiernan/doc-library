## Intro

while-true-do.io stands for Free/Libre Open Source contribution. It is coming
from the idea, that you should do whatever can be done, as long as it is
needed. Adding content to FLOSS / Open Source in one or another way was and
will always be the key intention behind while-true-do.io.

The Styling should reflect our intentions, motivation and ideals.

## Logo

The logo is a stylized turtle. The turtle stands for sustainability,
reliability, steadiness and wisdom. The form is defined by the infinity symbol
and is reflecting the "while true do = infinite loop" idea.

### Logo and Marque

## Typeface

For browser applications (like websites), one should rely on system fonts.
The user is already familiar with his system and should not be forced to use
another font.

On the other hand, on documents like \*.pdfs, written letters or when creating
images, one should rely on the below typefaces.

We have chosen a font, which is good looking, well known and easy to read. It
is also under a free license and widely used in Open Source environments.

**DejaVu Fonts**

**Example**


### Typeface Serif

Serif fonts are often used for documents on an analog medium like:

-   letters
-   paper documents
-   brochures

**Example**

### Typeface Mono

Mono fonts are quite technical and should only be used in a technical context
like:

-   code blocks
-   terminals

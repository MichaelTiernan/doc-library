# doc-library

A repository containing static documents.

## Motivation

During the past years, while-true-do.io opened and closed some repositories. We
faced the situation, that maintaining Guidelines and other general purpose
documents was somewhat tedious. Keeping track of documents should be easy and
centrally manageable.

## Description

This repository keeps track of common documents.

### Documents

Documents should not be included in your repository but linked. They will only
see updates in the doc-library.
